<b>Key facts</b><br>
Breast cancer caused 670 000 deaths globally in 2022.
Roughly half of all breast cancers occur in women with no specific risk factors other than sex and age.<br>
Breast cancer was the most common cancer in women in 157 countries out of 185 in 2022.<br>
Breast cancer occurs in every country in the world.<br>
Approximately 0.5–1% of breast cancers occur in men.<br>

xcited to share my recent project where I built a logistic regression model for breast cancer detection. Key highlights:

🔍 Data Prep: Cleaned and processed the dataset, converting labels to binary.

📊 Model Training: Achieved 94.7% accuracy on training data and 96.5% on testing data. Scaled features for better performance.

✅ Evaluation: Used precision, recall, and F1-score for comprehensive assessment. Developed a predictive tool for real-time classification.

💡 Takeaway: Simple models like logistic regression can be powerful in healthcare applications. Looking forward to exploring more advanced techniques!
